# README for the QT's Chess Learning App
# Introduction
This chess learning app offers lessons to teach 6 common chess tactics, with puzzles corresponding to each tactic to test and solidify the concepts taught in the lessons.

# Installation
To install this application, follow these steps:
1.	Ensure you have Qt5 installed on your system.
2.	Clone this repository: .
3.	Open the project in Qt Creator.
4.	Build and run the application.

# Usage
-	Click on a lesson and read through it to unlock the corresponding puzzle
- To complete a puzzle, move the pieces to do what the prompt tells you to. To move a piece, click it, at which point the valid positions to move to will be highlighted in green.
  Click to choose the position to move to. If you move incorrectly, you will be notified of the incorrect move and your position will be reset. If you need a hint, click the hint
  button to reveal the next correct move.
- Lessons and puzzles are initially locked until you complete the prerequisites, so your progress through the app will be saved as you complete them. To pick back up where you
  left off in your learning, hit the load puzzle button upon the app starting to go back to your furthest point of progress.
